/**
 * This file is used for mocking properties that you wish to pass into your widgets
 * global properties will be passed into all widgets when they render, and will be merged with widget specific properties
 * Widget props are defined under a <widgetName><version> property, with delimiters etc removed. Eg hello@1.0.0 would be hello100
 * See https://github.intuit.com/UX-Infra/test-plugin/blob/master/__mocks__/props.mock.js for an example
