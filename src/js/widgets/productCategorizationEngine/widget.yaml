    A product categorization engine is a system that is designed to automatically classify and organize products into various categories. This can be useful for e-commerce websites or other applications where products need to be sorted and organized in a logical and intuitive way. There are a variety of approaches that can be taken to build a product categorization engine, including using machine learning algorithms to analyze product data and assign categories based on patterns and similarities. Some systems may also allow for manual categorization of products by human users.
